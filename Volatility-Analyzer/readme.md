**Key Concepts:**

1. **Z-Score Definition:**
   - Z-score is a statistical measure that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. 
     It quantifies how far a particular data point is from the mean in terms of standard deviations.

2. **Interpreting VIX and Z-Score:**
   - **Decreasing Volatility (Z < 0):** Highlighted on the chart with green shades, indicating a more stable market environment. 
     In this scenario, the system suggests that SPY may **potentially experience an upward trend**.

     The system assists users in considering strategies that accommodate **potential market downturns**.
